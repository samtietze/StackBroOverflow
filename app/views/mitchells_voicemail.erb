    Heyy, mitch. Sam again. AJAX the comments please. I didn't add any classes to the <a> tags, though.

    I haven't finished the comments routes. I hope that isn't too big of a shitshow. I'll add more of them tonight. You should be able to generic-ize the AJAX calls, but let me know what issues you have!
